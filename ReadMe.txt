## Web API is created for Calculating premium:
--OccupationService
--PremiumCalculationService classes are created.


NOTE: I have created dictionary for Rating factors and occupation. We can fetch it from DB also.
Here for assign purpose I left that approach.

##For Front End I have created \CapGemini_Assignment\HTML Page To Test WEB API\Capgminni.htnml

It can be used from any path on same machine to check Web API.


## For validations there are some validation we can add such as
validation on Birth Date (should not future date)
Date format 
Age : Number only
etc.
